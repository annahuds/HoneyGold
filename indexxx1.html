          <td>Advanced Layout</td>
          <td>Create a more complex multi-column or nested layout using Bootstrap grid features.</td>
          <td>I created a multi-column layout in the Menu section using Bootstrap's grid system. The layout is divided into three columns on large screens and collapses into a single column on smaller screens.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Component Customisation</td>
          <td>Customise Bootstrap components (e.g., cards, buttons) beyond default styling using Bootstrap classes.</td>
          <td>I customised the Bootstrap cards by adding shadows (`shadow-lg`), borders (`border-primary`), and rounded corners (`rounded`), making them more visually appealing. The buttons were also customised with `btn-warning` and `w-100` to stand out.</td>

          <td>Implement a Bootstrap modal with additional content such as text, images, or a form.</td>

          <td>Breakpoints</td>
          <td>Use breakpoints and responsive classes to achieve fine-tuned layout adjustments.</td>
          <td>I used Bootstrap’s grid breakpoints (e.g., `col-md-4`, `col-6`) to make the layout responsive. On smaller screens, the menu items collapse into a single column for better viewing on mobile.</td>

        <tr>
          <td>Combined Styling</td>
          <td>Demonstrate the use of multiple Bootstrap utility classes together to achieve a refined design.</td>
          <td>I combined several utility classes like `fw-bold`, `ms-auto`, `bg-warning`, and spacing utilities like `py-5` to improve the page’s design and create spacing consistency.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Advanced Styling</td>
          <td>Include styling from a secondary source, e.g., animate.css or iconography from FontAwesome (or similar).</td>
          <td>I added Animate.css for header animations and FontAwesome icons in the footer for social media links to enhance visual appeal and interactivity.</td>
